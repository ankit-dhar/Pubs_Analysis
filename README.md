# Pubs_Analysis
I recently had the amazing opportunity to work on the Drinks Pricing and Sales Analysis challenge for Pubs "R" Us. It was an incredible experience delving into a pub chain's data and uncovering valuable insights about the drinks pricing and sales performance.

Using SQL queries, I was able to analyze the data and provide meaningful answers to critical business questions. From understanding the total sales amounts at each pub to identifying the top-selling beverages and even exploring customer ratings, this challenge allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the business.
